Hi 🙋 **Welcome** To The Boring Introduction. I would love to make a lot of **friends** and explore the world 🌍. 
By the way, I like to live **alone** with my own self, and please don’t ask me why I like that 🙊🙊🙊.

**Favorite celebrity and crush** 😍 Demi Lovato and Meghan Trainor. I like Demi's laugh 😁, that’s why I like her a lot. As for Meghan, I know she’s really hot, but I like her because she’s a good songwriter 📝 and singer too 😉😉😉. And here's a little secret, don’t tell anyone: I also like her lips 💋. 

**About names** - I have lots of names like bear 🐻 and Rock Star 💕. My Chinese name is Luoxite, my Turkish name is Baris (bari), my Portuguese name is Ursinho, my Spanish name is Hasani, and my Martian name is Maris.

**For work** - I can be lazy sometimes, but I'm usually active. I am fully talkative and helpful with everything.

**Down to** - Gain knowledge and learn about everything.

**Singing 🎶** - I like to sing. Most of the time, I sing 🎶 in private or in the shower 🚿.

**My favorites** - I ❤️ 🐶 🐻 🐱 🐹 🐿️ 🐼 💐 🌸 💮 🌺 🌲 🍇 🍒 🍓 🍔 🍦 🎂 🍪 🍼 ☕ 🍳 ✈️ 🚲 🚇 🏋️ 🚴 🏸 🎸 🎶 ⚽. These are my all-time favorites.

**Bad habits** - I eat a lot (I think the whole day). I watch **YouTube** while working. I never go to work on time. I mostly listen 👂 to songs with high notes. I like taking pictures, but not of myself 😔. My favorite cold drinks are Happy Fizz and Coca-Cola. I'm a **vegetarian**👿👿👿. I don't like **sleeping** so much. Sometimes, I speak a lot without any **reason**.

**Crush** - I like **Lalisa Manoban** from (BP), not because she is a singer or something, I just like her because she is **funny and cute**.

**Singers** - Bleta **(Bebe)** Rexha, **Adele** (a high notes singer-songwriter), Beyoncé, Elena Jane Goulding, Jennifer Lynn Lopez, Ariana Grande-Butera, Miley Ray Cyrus, Elizabeth Woolridge (Lana Del Rey), Dua Lipa, Rita Sahatçiu Ora
